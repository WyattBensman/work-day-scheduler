# work-day-scheduler
This an application of a calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).

## Description

This application allows users to keep track of their busy schedules by allowing them to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). The project makes it easy fill in your schedule, while being able to keep up with what events have passed, are present & coming up due to each block being color coded!

## Usage

For a user to successfully use thie website they'll start by filling in each box with what's on their current schedule. Once a user fills in a box, they'll have to click the 'save' button on the far right of each box. This will save the content written in the box to their local storage unit so that they can come back to the website & not lose their schedule.

In order to stay on track of your day, the website also color-codes each box based on whether the event has passed, is present or coming up!
- A 'Red' box is present
- A 'Green' box is upcoming
- A 'Grey' box is past
